## Ingredients

### Dough

* 1000g flour (type 550)
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 0.5l warm soy milk (unsweetened) (warm means below 50 degrees Celsius)
* 80g vegan butter or margarine or some plant fat
* 2 packs of dry yeast (7g of dry yeast for 500g flour per pack)
* 90ml aqua faber (juice from a chickpea can)
* (sunflower oil if the dough is too sticky while kneading)

### Sauerkraut Filling

* 800g sauerkraut (for example mild wine sauerkraut)
* 2 large carrots
* 4 onions
* 6 tablespoons of sunflower oil
* salt
* black pepper

## Steps

### Dough

1. aqua faber, salt and sugar in a bowl and beat until white foamy
2. add warm milk, softened butter and yeast to bowl
3. add sieved flour to bowl
4. knead with hands until all flour is properly integrated and the dough feels smooth
   * if the dough is sticky, while kneading add a little oil to your hands
5. form the dough into a ball and let it rest in an enclosed room-temp location for at least an hour

### Sauerkraut Filling

1. add oil to pot and heat at medium heat
2. add roughly chopped onions and carrots to pot
3. sauté until onions are slightly see-through
4. add sauerkraut to pot
5. simmer at low heat for a decent amount of time, whatever feels right
6. drain of remaining liquid, the liquid will mess up the dough otherwise
7. season to taste with salt and pepper

### Pirogi

this part is practice and vibes, grandma does not know how she knows, she knows, so must we

1. you will probably have to split the dough into multiple pieces
2. roll out the rough until reasonably thin (it is all vibes-based as grandma intended)
3. cut into pieces, about twice as big as you want your pirogi to be from a surface area
4. put a spoonful or so of sauerkraut in the center of the dough
5. fold the dough up and crimp it tight with your fingers
6. heat up a pan at middle-to-high heat with a bunch of sunflower oil
7. toss some pirogi in there, bake on both sides until nice golden brown
8. repeat until all pirogi are baked
9. life is good now, you may enjoy pirogi and rest, they are good with potato soup
