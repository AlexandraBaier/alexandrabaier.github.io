# Recipes

I really really enjoy vegan cooking and cooking inclusive (hopefully ethical) meals for others.
On this page you can find links to recipes developed by myself and in collab with other beings.
I also provide some links to external recipes I can recommend based on personal experience.

A quick note:
A lot of my cooking happens together with others to feed many beings.
As a consequence, some of these recipes are larger than usual
and built to allow parallelization or faster results.
(Going faster can cause slightly lower quality, like adding extra yeast for faster doughs.)

## Own recipes

* [garlic-bread-crusted pasta casserole](https://entropia.de/Knoblauchbrotiger_Nudelauflauf)
  * language: German
  * original name: Knoblauchbrotiger Nudelauflauf
  * portions: at least 10
  * garlic-bread crust is a great alternative to cheese on casserole and just superior to vegan cheeses
* [pumpkin pasta with deep-fried julienned leeks and walnuts](https://entropia.de/K%C3%BCrbispasta_mit_Lauchstroh_und_Waln%C3%BCssen)
  * language: German
  * original name: Kürbispasta mit Lauchstroh und Walnüssen
  * portions: 20
  * looks very fancy and is budget-friendly, check the picture on the website
* [pumpkin pizza](https://entropia.de/K%C3%BCrbispizza)
  * language: German
  * original name: Kürbispizza
  * portions: 2 sheet pans of pizza
  * also pretty fancy, gives off gastro-pub vibes
* [vegan doner](https://entropia.de/Veganer_D%C3%B6ner)
  * language: German
  * original name: Veganer Döner
  * portions: around 20
  * big rec vegan döner goes very hard
  * the yoghurt sauce is so good
* [vegan lasagna](https://entropia.de/Vegane_Lasagne)
  * language: German
  * original name: Vegane Lasagne
  * portions: 4 to 5
  * it is a very tasty lasagna
  * the recipe uses a mushroom tomato ragout instead of a soy-based bolognese
  * I imagine a soy-based bolognese would also go hard
* [vegan pirogi]({% post_url 2025-11-16-vegan-pirogi %})
  * language: English
  * portions: honestly I don't know? at least 8 beings will not go hungry
  * this one feels very nostalgic to me
  * it is the veganized version of my grandma's recipe but without any discernible reduction in quality

## Other recipes

* [vegan cheesecake](https://veggie-einhorn.de/bester-veganer-kaesekuchen/)
  * last accessed: 2025-12-22
  * language: German
  * pleasant vanilla-lemon flavor
  * very similar to a traditional German cheesecake in consistency and vibe
  * sugar in the filling is somewhat optional, I tried it with 100% and 0% sugar both were nice
